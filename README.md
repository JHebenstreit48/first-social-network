## Contributions

I just used the mini-project or activity 28 for Module 14 as the starter code for the project. I also used videos I recorded from sessions with instructor and TAs to help me with things I did not understand. I also used ChatGPT and GitHub CoPilot at times when I struggled but they were not always a great help.

## Tests

I used ```npm run build``` and ```npm run start``` to continuously start and stop the server during testing.
